/*For the prelab assignment, you may not use the if statement, the if/else, nor the while statement.
The goal of the prelab is to print out all integers from 1 through 10 as words. For example, if the integer
is 1, you should print “one”. If the integer is 2, you should print “two”. Do not “hard code” things (i.e.,
don’t just print “one two three four five six seven eight nine ten” but instead loop through all the
integers. You may use a for loop or a do/while loop to accomplish this. Inside your loop, you will need
some way to decide what to print based on the value of the current integer. To accomplish this part,
consider using a switch or the ternary operator.*/

int main()
{
    for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
        switch(i){

            break;
            case 2: printf("two ");
            break;
            case 3: printf("three ");
            break;
            case 4: printf("four ");
            break;

            break;
            case 6: printf("six ");

            case 7: printf("seven ");
            break;
